Hello, I’m Sara!
I am a student at HACK A BOSS, currently enrolled in an AI & Data Science bootcamp.
Next year, I plan to return to the UK to study a degree in Artificial Intelligence.
My dream is to become an ML engineer.
My other interests are Mathematics, Health and Neuroscience.
I also love cats! 🐱
